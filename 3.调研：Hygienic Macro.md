# Hygienic macro

> 卫生宏的展开保证不会 意外地与标识符冲突

**Hygienic macros** are [macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)) whose expansion is guaranteed not to cause the accidental capture of [identifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiers). They are a feature of [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language) such as [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)),[(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro#cite_note-r5rs-1) [Dylan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dylan_(programming_language))[(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro#cite_note-dylan-2) and [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)). The general problem of accidental capture was well known within the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) community prior to the introduction of hygienic macros. Macro writers would use language features that would generate unique identifiers (e.g., gensym) or use obfuscated identifiers in order to avoid the problem. Hygienic macros are a programmatic solution to the capture problem that is integrated into the macro expander itself. The term "hygiene" was coined in Kohlbecker et al.'s 1986 paper that introduced hygienic macro expansion, inspired by the terminology used in mathematics.[(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro#cite_note-hygiene-3)

## The hygiene problem

In programming languages that have non-hygienic macro systems, it is possible for existing variable bindings to be hidden from a macro by variable bindings that are created during its expansion. In [C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)), this problem can be illustrated by the following fragment:

  ```C
  #define INCI(i) do { int a=0; ++i; } while(0)
  int main(void)
  {
      int a = 4, b = 8;
      INCI(a);
      INCI(b);
      printf("a is now %d, b is now %d\n", a, b);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  Running the above through the [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) produces:

  ```C
  int main(void)
  {
      int a = 4, b = 8;
      do { int a=0; ++a; } while(0);
      do { int a=0; ++b; } while(0);
      printf("a is now %d, b is now %d\n", a, b);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  The variable `a` declared in the top scope is shadowed by the `a` variable in the macro, which introduces a new [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)#Lexical_scoping). As a result, it is never altered by the execution of the program, as the output of the compiled program shows:

  ```
  a is now 4, b is now 9
  ```

> 一种解决该问题的常用的 Trade-off 是使用一个几乎不会被使用的名字来防止冲突。

  The simplest solution is to give the macros variables names that do not conflict with any variable in the current program:

  ```C
  #define INCI(i) do { int INCIa=0; ++i; } while(0)
  int main(void)
  {
      int a = 4, b = 8;
      INCI(a);
      INCI(b);
      printf("a is now %d, b is now %d\n", a, b);
      return 0;
  }
  ```

  Until a variable named `INCIa` is created, this solution produces the correct output:

  ```
  a is now 5, b is now 9
  ```

> 虽然不倾向于发生，但是如果用户故意使用宏中的专用名字来作为宏的参数，仍然会引发问题。

  The problem is solved for the current program, but this solution is not robust. The variables used inside the macro and those in the rest of the program have to be kept in sync by the programmer. Specifically, using the macro `INCI` on a variable `INCIa` is going to fail in the same way that the original macro failed on a variable `a`.

> 下面是 Common Lisp 的例子，其中没有在宏中新增标识符，但是做了对其中的 `if` `not` `progn` 的语义的假设，而在 Common Lisp 中，没有 C 中那样始终不可能改变的关键字，即使是像 `if` 那样的符号也是可以改变语义绑定的。比如下例中使用 `flet` 来改变了 `not` 的 符号绑定，使其不再发挥原有的作用，使宏产生与预期不相符的行为。

  The "hygiene problem" can extend beyond variable bindings. Consider this [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp) macro:

  ```commonlisp
   (defmacro my-unless (condition &body body)
    `(if (not ,condition)
       (progn
         ,@body)))
  ```

  While there are no references to variables in this macro, it assumes the symbols "if", "not", and "progn" are all bound to their usual definitions. If, however the above macro is used in the following code:

  ```commonlisp
   (flet ((not (x) x))
     (my-unless t
       (format t "This should not be printed!")))
  ```

  The definition of "not" has been locally altered and so the expansion of `my-unless` changes. (Redefining standard functions and operators, globally or locally, actually invokes [undefined behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undefined_behavior) according to ANSI Common Lisp. Such usage can be diagnosed by the implementation as erroneous.)

  On the other hand, hygienic macro systems preserve the lexical scoping of all identifiers (such as "if" and "not") automatically. This property is called *referential transparency*.

  Of course, the problem can occur for program-defined functions which are not protected in the same way:

  ```commonlisp
   (defmacro my-unless (condition &body body)
    `(if (user-defined-operator ,condition)
       (progn
         ,@body)))

   (flet ((user-defined-operator (x) x))
     (my-unless t
       (format t "This should not be printed!")))
  ```

  The Common Lisp solution to this problem is to use packages. The `my-unless` macro can reside in its own package, where `user-defined-operator` is a private symbol in that package. The symbol `user-defined-operator` occurring in the user code will then be a different symbol, unrelated to the one used in the definition of the `my-unless` macro.

  Meanwhile, languages such as [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)) that use hygienic macros prevent accidental capture and ensure referential transparency automatically as part of the macro expansion process. In cases where accidental capture is desired, some systems allow the programmer to explicitly violate the hygiene mechanisms of the macro system.

  For example, the following Scheme implementation of `my-unless` will have the desired behavior:

  ```scheme
   (define-syntax my-unless
     (syntax-rules ()
       ((_ condition body ...)
        (if (not condition)
            (begin body ...)))))

    (let ((not (lambda (x) x)))
      (my-unless #t
        (display "This should not be printed!")
        (newline)))
  ```

###  在不卫生的宏策略下的解决方法

## Strategies used in languages that lack hygienic macros

In some languages such as [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp), Scheme and others of the [Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)) language family, macros provide a powerful means of extending the language. Here the lack of hygiene in conventional macros is resolved by several strategies.

> 混淆：使用正常情况下不可能被使用的标识符来避免冲突

- Obfuscation

  If temporary storage is needed during the expansion of a macro, unusual variable names can be used in hope that the same names will never be used in a program that uses the macro.

> 有一些语言可以生成一系列唯一的标识符，并将其绑定给局部储存空间，并且这些标识符是保证不会与程序员自己写的标识符冲撞的。例如，许多 Lisp 系语言具有 `gensym`  函数来达到这一功能。

- Temporary symbol creation

  In some programming languages, it is possible for a new variable name, or symbol, to be generated and bound to a temporary location. The language processing system ensures that this never clashes with another name or location in the execution environment. The responsibility for choosing to use this feature within the body of a macro definition is left to the programmer. This method was used in [MacLisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacLisp), where a function named `gensym` could be used to generate a new symbol name. Similar functions (usually named `gensym` as well) exist in many Lisp-like languages, including the widely implemented [Common Lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp)standard[[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro#cite_note-4) and [Elisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisp).

> 在读到宏中的符号的时候，使用不会与宏外冲突的符号来代替。

- Read-time Uninterned Symbol

  This is similar to the first solution in that a single name is shared by multiple expansions of the same macro. Unlike an unusual name, however, a read time uninterned symbol is used (denoted by the `#:` notation), for which it is impossible to occur outside of the macro.

> 使用 package 的结构来防止宏内的符号与外界冲突。

- Packages

  Instead of an unusual name or an uninterned symbol, the macro simply uses a private symbol from the package in which the macro is defined. The symbol will not accidentally occur in user code. User code would have to reach inside the package using the double colon (`::`) notation to give itself permission to use the private symbol, for instance `cool-macros::secret-sym`. At that point, the issue of accidental lack of hygiene is moot. Thus the Lisp package system provide a viable, complete solution to the macro hygiene problem, which can be regarded as an instance of name clashing.

> 处理宏的时候，如果发现了内外的符号冲突，则使用生成的独特标识符来代替，以避免。

- Hygienic transformation

  The processor responsible for transforming the patterns of the input form into an output form detects symbol clashes and resolves them by temporarily changing the names of symbols. This kind of processing is supported by Scheme's `let-syntax` and `define-syntax` macro creation systems. The basic strategy is to identify *bindings* in the macro definition and replace those names with gensyms, and to identify *free variables* in the macro definition and make sure those names are looked up in the scope of the macro definition instead of the scope where the macro was used.

- Literal objects

  In some languages the expansion of a macro does not need to correspond to textual code; rather than expanding to an expression containing the symbol `f`, a macro may produce an expansion containing the actual object referred to by `f`. Similarly if the macro needs to use local variables or objects defined in the macro's package, it can expand to an invocation of a closure object whose enclosing lexical environment is that of the macro definition.
